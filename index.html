                        My name is Steve Munoz, and I'm a part time full stack developer student at UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. I'm currently working full time as Utilities Specialist for Aeparmia Engineering. Originally from Burbank, California and moved to central Texas 11 years ago. I consider myself an Austinite as I am ingrained in the city's culture of eating breakfast tacos consistently and keeping Austin weird. I enjoy the the outdoors alot, so on weekends I'm most likely hiking the beautiful hills that surrounds the city or kayaking Lake Travis. I tend to keep a strict fitness regimen of working out a minimum of three times a week. I also enjoy traveling, meeting new people, and attending salsa/bachata socials.

                        <p>
                            Dedicated and passionate about full stack development, I have strived to engulf myself in learning and practicing alll there is to know about being a full stack developer. I have utilized different resources such as taking online classes on Udemy.com, Coursea.com, EDX.org, and now taking a coding bootcamp at UT Austin. I am confident that my skills will only improve over the next upcoming months. I am goal oriented and hungry for knowledge.
