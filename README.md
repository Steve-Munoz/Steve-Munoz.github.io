# Introduction

A portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills.

# About Steve-Munoz.github.io

I incorporated containers, rows, columns into my HTML and referenced Boostrap to build a portoflio faster. I used row, column, container for each section like Navbar, portfolio section, contact section,skills, and about me section. I was then able to make each page responsive to the size of the screen. Also it's mobile friendly!
